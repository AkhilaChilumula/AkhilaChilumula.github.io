        It all began when I first met you at the orientation and didn't think much of it then,
        but little did I know that it would change the course ofour life. 
        After our second meet at Rithika's house party I was impressed by your ways of thinking and beliefs, 
        that did not change much after.

          Thank you for never giving up on us, thank you for always being there, 
          thank you for constantly making me feel appreciated, wanted and loved.

          I’m proud of us of what we’ll built, what we’ll learned, and what we’ll becoming.
          And no matter what the days look like, I want you to know this:
          you are deeply loved, and you will never be alone in this life with me.
